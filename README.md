# Hack-Challenge

App Name: QuizRizz 

QuizRizz is an app that allows users to effortlessly create, edit, and practice
with private flashcard decks for an easy and effective learning experience.

Github Repo: https://github.com/GraceW03/Hack-Challenge.git


Description:
The app makes users log in/create an account, so any flashcard decks that are 
created are personal to each user. Users start out on the homepage, which
displays the folders that they've created. They can then open each folder to look
at the sets in the folder. Opening a deck shows all the cards that are in that 
deck, and they can then use the cards to study (the app shows one card at a time,
randomly, and the user can flip the card over to see the answer). Users can create
folders, sets, and cards.

Requirements:
Front-end: We have multiple screens that users can navigate between, and it is
fully integrated with the back-end.

Back-end: We have three tables in our database. There is a one-to-many relationship
between users and sets, and a one-to-many relationship between sets and cards. There
are multiple routes in the app.py. Our api specification can be found at

Design: All designs and the design kit are completed, and can be found here
